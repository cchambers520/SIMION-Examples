# SIMION-Examples

I have made this repo to store simple examples of SIMION code for reference. Ideally, I can add to this repo whenever I want to try a new method in SIMION on a toy model that I know works.

## Toy Model: Steering Plates

This geometry was coded from scratch in the 'steeringPlates.gem' file. This simple model consists of two pairs of steering plates, one in the y-direction and the other in the z-direction. Electrodes 1 and 2 steer in the z-direction, and electrodes 3 and 4 steer in the y-direction. Each of the 4 electrodes can be individually biased. The refined PA is shown below:
